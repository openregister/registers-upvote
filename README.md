# GOV.UK Register Upvote

## Firebreak - Q3-Q4 17/18

**A page that includes options to:**
- express interest as a potential data source - provide contact details to the GOV.UK Registers Team (not public)
- express interest as a potential user (publicly visible as a +1 for that register)
- provide contact details & service description/link/name to GOV.UK Registers Team (not public)

**so that:**
- users can have input into which registers are prioritised next
- data owners can see the level of interest in register datasets they own
- we can stay in touch with users interested in a given register when it makes progress, if they want us to
